I suck at introductions and have spent the past hour or so customising word press themes to dodge this post. After numerous attempts of trying to find just the right blue (like almost mint, but like, not mint) for my background (I swear I moved the toggle more ways than one. Why did it look like the same darn blue?), I am forced to face the inevitable.

So how did this blog endeavour become official? During a discussion with my younger sister about the possibility of mermaids birthing live merdrin (mer + children) like guppies or the likelihood of my version of green being entirely different to hers (and different for every individual), I mentioned perhaps starting a blog. "Yes! Do it!" She replied emphatically. So here I am. Albeit it's been months since that day, I made it, kids.

The thought of starting a blog, however, did not begin with birthing mermaids or probable ocular deficiencies. It started with homeschooling.

Yes, I homeschool my children and we are religious (do you know Jesus Christ? Haha I'm kidding. Or am I? Haha okay I am not). No, I am not yet a homesteading wife mashing grapes with my toes. But who knows, you may one day enjoy a glass of fermented juice made with my bare feet.

Anyway, I figured it would be fun to document the homeschooling journey (my children are really cool, if I say so myself). As well as every other thing that I decide to overshare. And I indeed overshare *cue valley girl definitive hand wave with wide eyed nod* like, really. So talofa and welcome. And salute. The Italian kind.
